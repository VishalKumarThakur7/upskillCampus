# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts house prices using Machine Learning models based on housing features such as:

- Area
- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Other housing attributes

The project compares multiple machine learning algorithms and selects the best performing model based on accuracy.

This project was developed during my **Industrial Internship in Data Science & Machine Learning**.
